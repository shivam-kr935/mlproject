##End to End Machine Learning Project
#mlproject
An end-to-end machine learning project that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a data science application, from data preprocessing to model deployment. This project is structured to provide a clear understanding of how to build and deploy a machine learning model using Python and popular libraries.​

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:​

Python 3.6 or higher​

pip​

virtualenv (optional but recommended)​

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/shivam-kr935/mlproject.git
cd mlproject
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧪 Usage
Running the Application
To start the Flask application:​

bash
Copy
Edit
python application.py
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.​

Training the Model
To train the machine learning model:​

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/pipeline/train_pipeline.py
This script will handle data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and saving the trained model to the artifacts/ directory.​

🛠️ Deployment
Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
The project includes configuration files for deploying the Flask application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.​

Initialize Elastic Beanstalk:

bash
Copy
Edit
eb init -p python-3.7 mlproject
Create an environment and deploy:

bash
Copy
Edit
eb create mlproject-env
eb deploy
Ensure you have the AWS CLI and EB CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.​

📊 Project Details
Data Preprocessing: Handled in the src/components/data_preprocessing.py module.​

Model Training: Implemented using CatBoost in the src/components/model_trainer.py module.​

Web Interface: Built with Flask, templates located in the templates/ directory.​
